            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I was born in Ibadan, Nigeria in 2005. My family moved to the United States in 2011, where we first lived in South Carolina.<br>
            Afterwards, we moved to Florida, where I lived from about ages 8 to 11. Then, we moved to Indiana where I spent the majority of my<br>
            middle/high school career. I now live near Pittsburgh, PA where I am finishing my senior year of high school.</p>

        <div class="interests"><h2>Interests</h2><p>Coding is one of my passions, and this website pays homage to that. I created this website using HTML and CSS<br>
        and I've also created many other projects using JavaScript, and eventually I hope to learn more languages such as Python and C++. I play soccer regularly<br>
        and I also ran track for a few years in high school. More information about this is under the <a href="athletics.html">'Athletics'</a> tab on the home page. I love listening<br>
        to music and my favorite genres are jazz, bossa nova, and hip hop. I enjoy breathtaking views and landscapes. You can see some<br>
        photos I've taken <a href="landscapes.html">here</a>.I enjoy playing video games and watching anime in my free time. My favorite<br>
        video games are Darwin Project and Fifa and my favorite anime is One Piece.</p>

         <h2>Lifestyle/Philosophy</h2>
         <p>I am a strong believer in God, so I try to live my life in a way that pleases Him. No matter<br>
            what I do, I do it to the best of my ability. I live life to the fullest while maintaining a set of values and morals. I exercise regularly<br>
            and keep a healthy diet. Being kind to everyone regardless of their background, race, gender, or ethnicity is something I try to do always.<br>
            Taking care of the people close to me is a responsibility I must cherish and keep. My philosophy in life is to enjoy<br>
            the little moments, be kind no matter what, and to excel in all my endeavors.
